# Electron Base App
A simple basic Electron base set up.  Some type of boilerplate to start a/add to project, to save time.

### this install is currently for Mac OSX and is in constant developement.
__Use the master branch for the latest stable verison.__

For the moment to install, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:simondavies/electron-vuejs-starter.git
```

```
cd electron-base-app
```


Once you have entered the folder first you will need to run the following within terminal (MAC):

```
sudo npm install
```

Once all the packages have downloaded, run:

```
gulp
```

This should run the gulp process and set up the css and js files for running the app.

So that's all done you say...! No lets see if that works as seemingly as it should first time. Within the terminal run the following code.

```
npm start
```

Once loaded for now you should see a dark window and the developers tools open.


This will probably be update on a none specified time scale...
